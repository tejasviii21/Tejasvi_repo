ICIC3S Website


I successfully completed a responsive website project during my internship at IIIT Una. Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, I crafted a six-page site with a focus on responsive design, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices. The use of Bootstrap streamlined development, while JavaScript enhanced interactivity. The project showcases my proficiency in web development, offering a clean layout and visually appealing design. I appreciate the guidance from the IIIT Una team and am open to feedback. This experience has enriched my skills, and I look forward to applying them in future projects.
